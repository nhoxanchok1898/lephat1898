2. Locate the most recent backup.
3. Follow the documented restore process specific to the type of backup.
4. Validate the restoration by accessing key data and services.

## RTO/RPO Metrics
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: 4 hours
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: 1 hour

## Testing Backup Restoration
- Conduct quarterly drills to test the restoration process.
- Document issues and improve procedures based on the results of each drill.
- Ensure all team members are trained on the backup and recovery processes.
